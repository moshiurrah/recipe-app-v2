# Project 4: Dynamic Recipe Storage App Backend Overhaul

## Overview

Fullstack application being developed for educational purposes, using the MERN stack.
ClementineJS boilerplate is being used in conjunction with create-react-app.

### Objectives

* Take existing app and improve the back end with knowledge acquired over the past projects
* The following changes are planned:
  * Use of es6 code/transpiling with babel
  * Usage of MySQL database instead of Mongo (or perhaps in conjunction)
  * Integration of Redis for sessions storage
  * Improvements to async code with async/await functions in conjunction with promises
  * Authentication with JWT
  * Unit testing with Mocha
  * Updated routing strategies
  * General code cleanup following best practices
